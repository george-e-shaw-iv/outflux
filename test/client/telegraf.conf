    ## We bind to 8086 here because that is the default influxdb port and we want telegraf
    ## to basically be a proxy to influxdb. Because we do this, we need the actual influxdb
    ## on the client to be listening on a different port (not 8086), since telegraf and the
    ## client influxdb are sitting on the same network.
